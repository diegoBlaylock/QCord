# QCord
A Discord Bot implementation of a Question Reader

This project provides a simple question reader for discord. The current version relies on json files named after subcategories containing questions and a file named `"token"` containing the token

The project is still in development with the idea of using the online [QuizDB](quizdb.org) database to pull questions. The current answer system compares for exact answer, so later versions will make the comparison more "fuzzy".
